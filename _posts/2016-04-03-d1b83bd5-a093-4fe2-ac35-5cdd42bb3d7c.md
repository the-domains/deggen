I can offer significant value to any company which is open to technical innovation and lateral thinking. Whether as a video consultant for investing in your own equipment and building your own office studio, or assisting with technical aspects of your business such as choosing the best lighting for your office to promote productivity, or assisting with the implementation of accepting Bitcoin payments for your products and services.

With this in mind, I am happy to train your own in house staff to use equipment for your own productions.
