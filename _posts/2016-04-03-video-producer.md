I have been operating cameras professionally since 2006\. My extensive range of experience has given me a robust foundation of knowledge. This helps me adapt to new equipment quickly so that I can provide the highest grade footage possible every time. If you need a specific camera for a job - I can get a hold of it through my strong business connections in the area. On the other hand if you're not sure what options are available, I can give you advice on which equipment to consider. Be it be a Blackmagic Pocket Cam, or a Red Epic - I've shot with them all, and can help you get the most out of your budget.
