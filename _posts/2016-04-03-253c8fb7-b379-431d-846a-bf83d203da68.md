I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.

I am a very technical, problem solving Cinematographer. I can add value to your production by offering quickly implemented creative solutions which move the production along without sacrificing important turning points or the intended mood of the scene.

With experience managing a team of four camera / grip / gaffer crew, as well as a year as a student TV station controller, I'm very comfortable in a head of department role. Having worked professionally in every part of Camera & Electrical department, I have a strong understanding of each role's responsibilities and an appreciation of each individual's efforts on set.

If you are in need of a no-bullshit, hard working director of photography for your production, please get in touch now.
