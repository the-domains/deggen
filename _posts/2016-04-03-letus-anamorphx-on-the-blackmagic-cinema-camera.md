description: 'A week or so ago we ordered a Letus AnamorphX 1.33x anamorphic adapter. It arrived with five hours to spare before the Glasgow 48 hour film project. Phew! That was a nail biter. First off I wanted to show the squeeze factor, by filming a circular plate, and overlaying a perfect circle.'
