description: "Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive. No frills, nothing fancy, just a solid 1.6kg block of metal which records exactly what's in front of it. Perfect. After filming for a few hours on the afternoon we received it, I discovered that it is also totally unforgiving."
