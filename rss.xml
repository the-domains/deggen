            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Build Your Own Chinaball for Cinematic Lighting</h1><p>The first time I ever saw a Chinaball on a set was whilst watching the extra features on the Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull DVD. I've found that exact moment on youtube, here it is: behind the scenes It's just a tiny glimpse, but ever since then it's been sitting in the back of my mind.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f738588f95db5485f7a16288cdb7ea86219dd73a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Better Lighting for Film Makers with FIPEL Technology</h1><p>Field Induced Polymer Electro-Luminenscence or FIPEL technology, is something film makers and video production crew could be using within the next year to create better looking images more safely and efficiently. It's been around for a decade or so, but recently some brilliant scientists (Dr. David L.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa5917a28ff9037a0db867fc9194ea4eca0f245a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lighting CRI and CT</h1><p>So the main problem is that the big movie cats often use giant lighting fixtures with 18,000 Watts of power driving them, blasted through giant diffusion silks. Us film kittens can't do that because it would cost more monies than are currently available to us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e1c5317427905b96e4ba7a0d04aff68b22c34d1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Make Your Own DCP]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Make Your Own DCP</h1><p>The other day I succeeded in constructing my first ever DCP. It was a moment of great joy - the realisation of a dream - and I owe it all to free software from both commercial and open source software developers. If you don't know what a DCP is, then don't worry, neither did I a few weeks ago.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/313a37e2f394402717d7ddd14190c48384c751cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dual System Audio Syncing with Chirp</h1><p>I had a wonderful thought yesterday whilst listening to a podcast with Joe Rogan and Andreas Antonopoulos. They were speaking about Chirp. Chirp is a service which can encode any piece of data into a 20 tone audio clip which can be decoded by any Chirp client to link to the original data.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a1632d3c5f3524684c3d309273315885bc29a02e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p>]]></description>
