            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Producer]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Video Producer</h1><p>I have been operating cameras professionally since 2006. My extensive range of experience has given me a robust foundation of knowledge. This helps me adapt to new equipment quickly so that I can provide the highest grade footage possible every time. If you need a specific camera for a job - I can get a hold of it through my strong business connections in the area. On the other hand if you’re not sure what options are available, I can give you advice on which equipment to consider. Be it be a Blackmagic Pocket Cam, or a Red Epic - I’ve shot with them all, and can help you get the most out of your budget.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a4c571cd-313f-4a0f-baea-7bff535a310d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
