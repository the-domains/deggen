            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Camera First Impressions</h1><p>Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive. No frills, nothing fancy, just a solid 1.6kg block of metal which records exactly what's in front of it. Perfect. After filming for a few hours on the afternoon we received it, I discovered that it is also totally unforgiving.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/471934c8a29a5cb858ddb7b1db5305546935655e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
