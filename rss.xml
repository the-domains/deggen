            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Cameras Have Just Been Upgraded</h1><p>Blackmagic Design have really nailed this one out of the park. The latest firmware (v1.8) for the BMC upgrades it in to an all new level. The most important change for me has been the super improved anti-aliasing moire reduction function of the prores debayer.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Camera First Impressions</h1><p>Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive. No frills, nothing fancy, just a solid 1.6kg block of metal which records exactly what's in front of it. Perfect. After filming for a few hours on the afternoon we received it, I discovered that it is also totally unforgiving.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/471934c8a29a5cb858ddb7b1db5305546935655e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lighting CRI and CT</h1><p>So the main problem is that the big movie cats often use giant lighting fixtures with 18,000 Watts of power driving them, blasted through giant diffusion silks. Us film kittens can't do that because it would cost more monies than are currently available to us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e1c5317427905b96e4ba7a0d04aff68b22c34d1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
