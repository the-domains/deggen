            <title><![CDATA[Video Producer]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Video Producer</h1><p>I have been operating cameras professionally since 2006. My extensive range of experience has given me a robust foundation of knowledge. This helps me adapt to new equipment quickly so that I can provide the highest grade footage possible every time. If you need a specific camera for a job - I can get a hold of it through my strong business connections in the area. On the other hand if you’re not sure what options are available, I can give you advice on which equipment to consider. Be it be a Blackmagic Pocket Cam, or a Red Epic - I’ve shot with them all, and can help you get the most out of your budget.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Day #1 on the grid</h1><p>This is the day on which I first started building my site on thegrid.io. It's interesting. Perhaps the perfect place to share thoughts and photos without specific purpose, just to see how it decides to include it in the site. The intelligence is clearly artificial, but I'm intrigued by how this will progress in the coming years, and I'm glad to be an early adopter.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6430f18e-9001-491d-a7ee-c14a498c99e8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cinematographer</h1><p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p></article>]]></description>

The latest firmware (v1.8) for the BMC upgrades it in to an all new level. The most important change for me has been the super improved anti-aliasing moire reduction function of the prores debayer.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Camera First Impressions</h1><p>Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive. No frills, nothing fancy, just a solid 1.6kg block of metal which records exactly what's in front of it. Perfect. After filming for a few hours on the afternoon we received it, I discovered that it is also totally unforgiving.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/471934c8a29a5cb858ddb7b1db5305546935655e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
