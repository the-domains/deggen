            <title><![CDATA[Video Producer]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Video Producer</h1><p>I have been operating cameras professionally since 2006. My extensive range of experience has given me a robust foundation of knowledge. This helps me adapt to new equipment quickly so that I can provide the highest grade footage possible every time. If you need a specific camera for a job - I can get a hold of it through my strong business connections in the area. On the other hand if you’re not sure what options are available, I can give you advice on which equipment to consider. Be it be a Blackmagic Pocket Cam, or a Red Epic - I’ve shot with them all, and can help you get the most out of your budget.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cinematographer</h1><p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p></article>]]></description>

The latest firmware (v1.8) for the BMC upgrades it in to an all new level. The most important change for me has been the super improved anti-aliasing moire reduction function of the prores debayer.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Camera First Impressions</h1><p>Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive. No frills, nothing fancy, just a solid 1.6kg block of metal which records exactly what's in front of it. Perfect. After filming for a few hours on the afternoon we received it, I discovered that it is also totally unforgiving.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/471934c8a29a5cb858ddb7b1db5305546935655e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It arrived with five hours to spare before the Glasgow 48 hour film project. Phew! That was a nail biter.
