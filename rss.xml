            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cinematographer</h1><p>I have a decade of experience lighting and shooting films, using intuition and innovation to overcome budgetary restrictions. I am not an industry seasoned, award winning director of photography, nor do I have any cinematography qualifications to speak of. What I can offer your production is a great deal of experience using low budget equipment to create images which reveal story.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eb7f51ca-b726-4919-b3f2-7ad81c61ad00.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blackmagic Cinema Camera First Impressions</h1><p>Wow. This camera is an absolute joy to use. It's essentially a lens, sensor and solid state drive.
